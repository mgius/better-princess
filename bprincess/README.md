My 2.5 year old thinks Pretty Pretty Princess is a great game.

I beg to differ. Progress towards victory is random and capricious. Moves are
often wasted effort, there's no sense to it.

So I'm gonna make it better. But first, I need to simulate the game effectively.

This was half an excuse to use some early morning wakings effectively, half an
excuse to try out pattern matching from py310, and half me really hating pretty
pretty princess.
